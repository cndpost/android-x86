Android-x86 that includes all the drivers in installer




1. Introduction


One of the main drawbacks of the current android-x86 project is that it only has a minimum set of drivers that power up some basic PC devices, but it lacks the drivers for the many devices we have in our standard PC made by different manufacturers.


This fork of the android-x86 project is tring to make the
installers to have as many driver support as a linux OS can have from the device makers or third party driver developers.


Our goal is to make a single ISO installer image to contain as many device drivers as possible but we only put the needed drivers for the hardwares presented in the specific PC we are installing on. This keeps that installed system as lean as an android system is supposed to be.


2. Building the Android-x86 from source

  Initially I got the guid from this link:

  https://arachnoid.com/android/Android-x86/index.html

  However, some of the source check out links in this article is out of date. I have to make changes according to following official instructions to get the latest source code:
